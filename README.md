# amazon-cart

## an app written in ReactJs that emulates an online store 

This project is an example of an online store. It has two pages, home page and shop page, where you can
add chosen items to your shopping cart and also choose the quantity of the selected items. Once selected 
they are in your cart, where you can again edit the required quantity or delete it from your shopping cart.

In the top right corner you have a price box which shows the total amount of your cart in dollars. It changes
when you add items, delete items or change quantity. 

It also has a search box on the top left part of the page, where you can search for avilable items and then 
be redirected to shop page.

## How to run the project

- clone the project
- run command 'npm run' in your terminal

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

There are a few things that could be added or changed, for example:
- the proceed to checkout button doesn't have any functionality
- when you click on add to cart button it doesn't make any visual change
  that would indicate that you have actually clicked on it
- changing the quantity in the shopping cart doesn't always work, when there 
  are multiple items already selected
- search box could be visualy a lot nicer, especially when choosing between different items,
  it seems like everything is just stuck together(also it just directs you to the page,
  not an actual item at that page)
