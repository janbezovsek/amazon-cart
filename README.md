# amazon-cart

## an app written in ReactJs that emulates an online store 

This project is an example of an online store. It has two pages, home page and shop page, where you can
add chosen items to your shopping cart and also choose the quantity of the selected items. Once selected 
they are in your cart, where you can again edit the required quantity or delete it from your shopping cart.

In the top right corner you have a price box which shows the total amount of your cart in dollars. It changes
when you add items, delete items or change quantity. 

It also has a search box on the top left part of the page, where you can search for avilable items and then 
be redirected to shop page.
